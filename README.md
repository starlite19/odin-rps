# odin-rps
Building a rock paper scissors game using HTML and CSS and Javascript.
Project is deployed at https://starlite19.github.io/odin-rps/

This project focuses more on the basics of Javascript instead of UI features such as:
- Selecting from DOM using document.querySelector
- Adding to the DOM using document.createElement and .appendChild
- Updating the DOM through changing the assignment of .textContent
- Add event listeners (e.g. on button click)
